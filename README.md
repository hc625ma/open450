# open450
 open source 450 class rc helicopter
 
 RC helicopters are getting harder to find in local hobby shops, spare parts are scarce, 
 every minor damage to the airframe often grounds one for weeks. On the other hand, drones are everywhere!
 
 Easy to fly, even easier to maintain. But theres a thing they are not particularly good at - that is, 
 replacing the collective pitch helicopter. If you want to fly rc helicopters badly, but the whole idea seems
 too expensive and complicated - this is probably a nice starter machine for you.

 
 So, this is an attempt to take the best from both worlds: maintainability of drones where we have little 
 unique airframe/electronics parts - and the look and feel of rc helicopters.
